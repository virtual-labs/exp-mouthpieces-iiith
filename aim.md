A mouth piece is a short length of the pipe about three times its diameter connected to the face of an orifice, which is provided in the side or bottom of the vessel. It is used for the measurement of discharge of large quantities of liquid since; the rate of discharge through a mouth piece will be more than that of an orifice, for the same diameter and head. 

To determine the coefficients of discharge (Cod) of the given mouth piece.
