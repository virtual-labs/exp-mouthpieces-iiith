Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

1. Click/Tap on the **Start** button to start the experiment.
2. The water shall start flowing through the flow channel. The level in the first container shall start rising accordingly. The water will then flow out of the mouthpiece into the second container.
3. Eventually the water will fill both the containers.
4. Try to change the flow speed by using **Control flow speed** glider. Bringing the glider to the left will slow down the water flow whereas bringing it to the right will speed it up!
5. The **Control flow speed** glider is dynamic and can be changed midway when the water is filling up too. 
6. Click/Tap on the **Reset** button to restart the expeirment afresh, i.e., with empty apparatus.
