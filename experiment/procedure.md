 Procedure for the experiment is as follows.

1. Measure the internal diameter of the mouth piece using calipers.
2. Measure the internal plan dimensions of the collecting tank.
3. Open the inlet valve to allow the water in to the balancing tank.
4. Maintain a steady head in the balancing tank by operating the inlet valve
5. When the head causing flow is maintained constant, close the outlet valve of the collecting tank.
6. Using the stopwatch, note the time taken (t) for a known rise (H) of water level in the collecting.
7. Repeat the above procedure for at least five times and tabulate the observations.
8. Calculate the co-efficient of discharge, Cd for each observations and compute the average value.
